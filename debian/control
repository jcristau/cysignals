Description: interrupt and signal handling for Cython
 When writing Cython code, special care must be taken to ensure that the code
 can be interrupted with CTRL-C. Since Cython optimizes for speed, Cython
 normally does not check for interrupts. For example, code like the following
 cannot be interrupted in Cython: "while True: pass".
 The cysignals package provides mechanisms to handle interrupts (and other
 signals and errors) in Cython code.
